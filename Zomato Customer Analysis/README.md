### Data

TripleTen provided an archived file of 5 separate excel files from the mock company Zomato. I used 3 for this project.

- **Zomato data.zip**: Compressed Excel files provided by team lead.
- **orders**: All orders made from the menu by all customers at all restaurants between Oct. 4th 2017 and June 26th 2020.
- **users**: All customers who completed orders during the designated time frame and their demographic information.
- **restaurants**: From where they like to order and their demography.

### Description

This was a Customer Segmentation Analysis conducted over 18 pages in Tableau, with the purpose to successfully complete the Zomato onboarding project to showcase analytical skills to the mock company.

### Assumptions

- The provided test datasets are accurate, complete, and consistent.
- Missing values or inconsistencies are minimal and will not significantly impact the analysis.
- The column descriptions accurately reflect the content of each table.
- The provided tables (orders and users) contain all the necessary information for the chosen analysis.
- Zomato's business context and industry trends are considered while interpreting the data.

### Process

First, I understood the whole problem and what was needed to solve it. Then, I picked the right software and made a plan, which was my first step. Next, I looked at the data, made some visuals and dashboards for my second step. Last, I put all my findings into a simple report, making it my final step.

### Findings

1. The primary customer base is single men aged 23.
2. The age distribution is normally spread between 18 to 34 years, showing a narrow range.
3. While female customers are not far behind in numbers, singles significantly outnumber married individuals.
4. The typical Zomato user has a small household of 2-3 members, is well-educated, yet lacks employment.
5. Bikaner city residents prefer ordering from Baskin Robbins.
6. Zomato's marketing strategy should focus on reaching out to uneducated housewives.
