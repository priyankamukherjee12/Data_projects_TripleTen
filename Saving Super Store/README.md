# Saving Super Store

This was my fourth project that I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned for Tableau Visualization.

### Data

The data was one Excel spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen:

- **Superstore.xls**: each row corresponds to one product sold; sheets were LEFT JOIN'd
  - `orders`: details all fields for each ordered item
  - `returns`: details all fields for each returned item

### Description

- **10 page Tableau Visualization**
  - Includes data analysis, charts, and dashboards.
  - Purpose was to consult the company by reviewing the storeâ€™s operations and increase its profitability to avoid bankruptcy.

### Assumptions

- Total profits from sales are showing a negative balance.
- Negative profits are directly linked to issues with orders and returns.
- The operations department must implement changes to address these issues.
- The advertising department requires strategic recommendations to improve the situation.

### Process

- Initially, I combined the data sheets.
- Next, I identified the sources of profit and loss.
- Finally, I analyzed the impact of returns on profitability.

### Findings

1. Specific sub-categories were thriving or failing in different regions.
2. Some products have a negative profit and should be discontinued.
3. There are some sub-categories that are negative profit and should be discontinued.
4. There are some sub-categories that are high-profit and should get more focus.
5. The best advertising regions have different optimal time periods and budgets.
6. There are several products that have a return rate of 100% and should be discontinued.
7. The high-returns need to be investigated to prevent future problems.
